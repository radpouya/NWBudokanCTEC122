                The <strong>Northwest Budokan</strong> is one of the longest standing
                martial arts schools in the Vancouver, Washington area. Established in October
                of 1996 by Zachary Hanks, the school has promoted the dissemenation
                of three traditional martial arts: <em>Shotokan Karate</em>, <em>Japanese 
                Ju-Jitsu</em>, and <em>Ryukyu Kobudo</em>.

                As an established expert with twenty-five years of training in Japanese martial arts, Hanks is referred to by the title “Sensei”, meaning “one who has been before” or more colloquially, “instructor”. Sensei Hanks created the entire curriculum for the program, and oversees all 
                instruction, lesson plans, promotions, specialty seminars, and extra-curricular events. Sensei Hanks holds many competitive karate titles in fighting, forms, and weapons. He has also received much acclaim for his success as a children’s coach, and as a nationally certified referee.

                    As an established expert with twenty-five years of training in Japanese martial arts, Hanks is referred to by the title “Sensei”, meaning “one who has been before” or more colloquially, “instructor”. Sensei Hanks created the entire curriculum for the program, and oversees all 
                    <span class="redtext">instruction, lesson plans, promotions, specialty seminars, and extra-curricular events</span>. Sensei Hanks holds many competitive karate titles in fighting, forms, and weapons. He has also received much acclaim for his success as a children’s coach, and as a nationally certified referee.
